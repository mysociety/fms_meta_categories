#FixMyStreet Meta Categories

FixMyStreet uses different category names in different local authorities to match the internal descriptions used by the local authority. 

For analysis across areas, category names have to be combined. This repository contains lookups to combine into catgories at various levels of detail.

The SHEF categories were created by Elvis Nyanzu in 2018. 

SHEF_A - 94 Categories
SHEF_B - 29 Categories
SHEF_C - 8 Categories

These are not stackable - e.g. some base categories that have the same SHEF_B might not have the same SHEF_C.  

The purpose of this repository is to allow these lookups to be updated as new FixMyStreet categories are created - and to reduce the work needed to create differently focused lookups.
